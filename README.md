# Ontology development project for organizational strategy and planning structures

**Project Scope:**

- Developing an ontology for organizational strategy, vision, and planning
- Capturing entities like departments, goals, KPIs, budgets, and their relationships
- Multiple levels: organizational strategy → department plans → implementation

**Technical Approach:**

- Using AI tools (ChatGPT/Claude) to generate ontology definitions
- Output formats: RDF, OWL, or Neo4j
- Planning for iterative development
- Storage in GitHub repository for version control

**Development Strategy:**

- Start with core entities and relationships
- Validate AI-generated output manually
- Add entities incrementally (like budget associations)
- Focus on whether AI tools can generate usable ontologies before worrying about iteration

**Immediate Next Steps:**

- Test whether free AI tools can generate usable ontologies
- Sync up in the evening to review progress and assess capability
- Focus on proof-of-concept before considering iteration challenges
